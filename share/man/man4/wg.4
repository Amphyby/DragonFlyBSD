.Sh NAME
.Nm wg
.Nd WireGuard protocol driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
To load the driver as a module at boot time, place the following line in
.Xr rc.conf 5 :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
if_wg_load="YES"
.Ed
.Pp
To compile this driver into the kernel, add the following line to
.Xr kernconf 5
kernel configuration file:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
.Cd pseudo-device wg
.Ed
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides Virtual Private Network (VPN) interfaces for the secure
exchange of layer 3 traffic with other WireGuard peers using the WireGuard
protocol.
.Pp
A
.Nm
interface recognizes one or more peers, establishes a secure tunnel with
each on demand, and tracks each peer's UDP endpoint for exchanging encrypted
traffic with.
.Pp
The interfaces can be created at runtime using the
.Ic ifconfig Cm wg Ns Ar N Cm create
command, and then can be configured with
.Xr ifconfig 8 .
In addition, the
.Nm
.Xr rc 8
script can be used to easily manage the interfaces; refer to
.Xr rc.conf 5
and
.Xr wg.conf 5
for the details.
.Ss Terminology
The following glossary provides a brief overview of WireGuard terminology:
.Bl -tag -width indent -offset 3n
.It Peer
Peers exchange IPv4 or IPv6 traffic over secure tunnels.
Each
.Nm
interface may be configured to recognize one or more peers.
.It Key
Each peer uses its private key and corresponding public key to
identify itself to others.
A peer configures a
.Nm
interface with its own private key and with the public keys of its peers.
.It Pre-shared key
In addition to the public keys, each peer pair may be configured with a
unique pre-shared symmetric key.
This is used in their handshake to guard against future compromise of the
peers' encrypted tunnel if an attack on their Diffie-Hellman exchange
becomes feasible.
It is optional, but recommended.
.It Allowed IP addresses
A single
.Nm
interface may maintain concurrent tunnels connecting diverse networks.
The interface therefore implements rudimentary routing and reverse-path
filtering functions for its tunneled traffic.
These functions reference a set of allowed IP address ranges configured
against each peer.
.Pp
The interface will route outbound tunneled traffic to the peer configured
with the most specific matching allowed IP address range, or drop it
if no such match exists.
The interface will accept tunneled traffic only from the peer
configured with the most specific matching allowed IP address range
for the incoming traffic, or drop it if no such match exists.
That is, tunneled traffic routed to a given peer cannot return through
another peer of the same
.Nm
interface.
This ensures that peers cannot spoof one another's traffic.
.It Handshake
Two peers handshake to mutually authenticate each other and to
establish a shared series of secret ephemeral encryption keys.
Either peer may initiate a handshake.
Handshakes occur only when there is traffic to send, and recur every
two minutes during transfers.
.It Connectionless
Due to the handshake behavior, there is no connected or disconnected
state.
.El
.Ss Keys
Private keys for WireGuard can be generated from any sufficiently
secure random source.
The Curve25519 keys and the pre-shared keys are both 32 bytes
long and are commonly encoded in base64 for ease of use.
.Pp
Keys can be generated with
.Xr openssl 1
as follows:
.Pp
.Dl $ openssl rand -base64 32
.Pp
Although a valid Curve25519 key must have 5 bits set to specific values,
this is done by the
.Nm
interface and so it will accept any random 32-byte base64 string.
.Sh EXAMPLES
Create a
.Nm
interface and set random private key:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# ifconfig wg0 create
# ifconfig wg0 wgkey `openssl rand -base64 32` wgport 54321
.Ed
.Pp
Retrieve the associated public key from a
.Nm
interface:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
$ ifconfig wg0 | grep 'wgpubkey:'
.Ed
.Pp
By default, the private key and pre-shared key (if set) are hidden from
the interface status output, but can be made to show up by specifying the
.Fl k
flag for
.Xr ifconfig 8 :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# ifconfig -k wg0 | grep -E 'wgkey:|wgpsk:'
.Ed
.Pp
Connect to a specific endpoint using its public-key and set the
allowed IP address:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# ifconfig wg0 wgpeer <peer_pubkey> \\
	wgendpoint 10.0.1.100 54321 \\
	wgaip 192.168.2.100/32
.Ed
.Pp
Set description for a peer:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# ifconfig wg0 wgpeer <peer_pubkey> wgdescr <peer_description>
.Ed
.Pp
Remove a peer:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# ifconfig wg0 -wgpeer <peer_pubkey>
.Ed
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
The
.Nm
interface supports runtime debugging, which can be enabled with:
.Pp
.D1 Ic ifconfig Cm wg Ns Ar N Cm debug
.Pp
Some common error messages include:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Sy "Handshake for peer X did not complete after 5 seconds, retrying"
Peer X did not reply to our initiation packet, for example because:
.Bl -bullet -compact
.It
The peer does not have the local interface configured as a peer.
Peers must be able to mutually authenticate each other.
.It
The peer's endpoint IP address is incorrectly configured.
.It
There are firewall rules preventing communication between hosts.
.El
.It Sy "Invalid handshake initiation"
The incoming handshake packet could not be processed.
This is likely due to the local interface not containing
the correct public key for the peer.
.It Sy "Invalid initiation MAC"
The incoming handshake initiation packet had an invalid MAC.
This is likely because the initiation sender has the wrong public key
for the handshake receiver.
.It Sy "Packet has disallowed src IP from peer X"
After decryption, an incoming data packet has a source IP address that
is not assigned to the allowed IPs of Peer X.
